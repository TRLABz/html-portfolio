<h2>My Top 3 All-Time Favorite Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Last of the Mohicans</h3>

<p>This is just an EPIC film.  The plot, the acting, the passion and the cinematography... Top-notch!</p>

<h3>Champions</h3>

<p>After "Cheers" I've really never cared much for Woody Harrelson's work.  
    And, these days, most films are just such crap, either too erotic or too violent or too Satanic.  
    But in this day and age and from this actor came a really pleasant surprise in "Champions" (2023).
    Just a really heartwarming story about a guy to, after some resistance, eventually takes to heart
    his task of coaching some special needs people just for the sake of their own enjoyment of the game.

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>

<p>Man, that opening D-Day Scene.  I mean, what else...</p>
